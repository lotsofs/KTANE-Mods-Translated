    How do I configure this?\r\nA: There will be a configuration json in your ktane
    mod settings folder. By default, the module will pick any language at random from
    the 40+ available languages. However, you can can set UsellLanguages to false
    and remove/add any desired language codes to the LanguagePool list to truly customize
    your experience.\r\n\r\nQ: My (favorite) language isn't in the list!\r\nA: Hit
    me up with a message and we'll work together to have it added. \r\n\r\nQ: You
    mistranslated <word>!\r\nA: While for some languages I had people at my disposal
    who were able to help, for most languages I simply took the title of the color's
    WikiPedia page in the respective language. It is therefore likely that there might
    be certain grammatical rules I am not aware of that cause a slight mistranslation.
    Or maybe I just translated incorrectly altogether. Same answer though: Hit me
    up, we'll get it fixed!\r\n\r\nQ: No manual?\r\nA: I did not translate the manuals,
    as I do not speak most of these languages. Instead the module comes with a lookup
    table'esque manual for all languages. I welcome you to translate the manuals instead!
    \r\n\r\nQ: I made a manual!\r\nA: Awesome :D Inform the kind people over at ktane.timwi.de
    and they will work with getting your manual added there. Inform me too. I will
    happily link to your manual here on the Steam page. I can be found in the KTANE
    official Discord server, among other places.\r\n\r\nQ: Is this a one off thing?\r\nA:
    I did aim to make a framework that will be somewhat easy/quick to implement for
    other modules. However it's very robust as of still and I do not consider this
    finished or feature complete yet. For this one module though, I can release what
    I have. Particularly because I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to making
    this thing right now. This serves more a proof of concept.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you do
    this for <module name> too?\r\nA: Absolutely. However, I will need someone with
    more expertise in these languages to help me. Colour Flash has the benefit of
    not being a super complicated module so I could just fetch color names from WikiPedia,
    something I wouldn't be able to do for modules with more nuance.\r\n\r\nQ: Source\u203D\r\nA:
    You can find the source code at https://github.com/lotsofs/KTANE-Mods-Translated
    if you're interested in contributing, or want to build a version with a custom
    language. "
