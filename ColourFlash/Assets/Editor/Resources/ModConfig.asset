    not marked as having one as such. You can use the condensed manual at https://lotsofs.github.io/KTANE/Translated%20Modules/Colour%20Flash%20Condensed.html
    instead. Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in providing a translation
    manual for a language (including languages not present on the module yet).\r\n\r\nAlso
    supports Twitch Plays, w/ autosolver.\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\nQ: How do I configure this?\r\nA:
    There will be a configuration json in your ktane mod settings folder. By default,
    the module will pick any language at random from the 40+ available languages.
    However, you can can set UsellLanguages to false and remove/add any desired language
    codes to the LanguagePool list to truly customize your experience.\r\n\r\nQ: My
    (favorite) language isn't in the list!\r\nA: Hit me up with a message and we'll
    work together to have it added. \r\n\r\nQ: You mistranslated <word>!\r\nA: While
    for some languages I had people at my disposal who were able to help, for most
    languages I simply took the title of the color's WikiPedia page in the respective
    language. It is therefore likely that there might be certain grammatical rules
    I am not aware of that cause a slight mistranslation. Or maybe I just translated
    incorrectly altogether. Same answer though: Hit me up, we'll get it fixed!\r\n\r\nQ:
    Is this a one off thing?\r\nA: I did aim to make a framework that will be somewhat
    easy/quick to implement for other modules. However it's very robust as of still
    and I do not consider this finished or feature complete yet. For this one module
    though, I can release what I have. Particularly because I don't have a lot of
    time to dedicate to making this thing right now. This serves more a proof of concept.\r\n\r\nQ:
    Can you do this for <module name> too?\r\nA: Absolutely. However, I will need
    someone with more expertise in these languages to help me. Colour Flash has the
    benefit of not being a super complicated module so I could just fetch color names
    from WikiPedia, something I wouldn't be able to do for modules with more nuance.\r\n\r\nQ:
    Source\u203D\r\nA: You can find the source code at https://github.com/lotsofs/KTANE-Mods-Translated
    if you're interested in contributing, or want to build a version with a custom
    language."
